### Exercise 7.18

What is encapsulation? Why is it useful?

### Solution

Encapsulation is hiding the implementation of an object and creating a public
interface to interact with the object. It is useful to encapsulate because it
ensures user code does not accidentally modify structural code, and a change in
the implementation will not require user code to change anything.
