### Exercise 7.24

Give your `Screen` class three constructors: a default constructor; a
constructor that takes values of height and width and initializes the contents
to hold the given number of blanks; and a constructor that takes values for
height, width and a character to use as the contents of the screen.

### Solution

See `screen.h`. Note that instead of defining a third constructor, I have used a
default initalizer for character parameter to be a blank.
