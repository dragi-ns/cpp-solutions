### Exercise 14.30

Add dereference and arrow operators to your `StrBlobPtr` and `ConstStrBlobPtr`
classes that you defined in exercise 12.22 from &sect; 12.1.6. Note that the
operators in `ConstStrBlobPtr` must return `const` references because the `data`
member in `ConstStrBlobPtr` points to a `const vector`.

### Solution

See program files.
