### Exercise 14.41

Why do you suppose the new standard added lambdas? Explain when you would use a
lambda and when you would write a class instead.

### Solution

It is impractical to write an entire class-function to be used only once, like
in the previous exercise. However, when needed multiple times, a class-function
is quite useful and easier to understand abstractly rather than copy-pasting
lambda functions.
