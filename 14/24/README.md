### Exercise 14.24

Decide whether your class you used in exercise 7.40 from &sect; 7.5.1 needs a
copy- and move-assignment operators. If so, define those operators.

### Solution

No further operators are needed, including copy- and move-assignment operators,
because either it is illogical for books to have arithmetic/compound assignment
operators or because the synthesized assginment operators work well for the
built-in class members.
