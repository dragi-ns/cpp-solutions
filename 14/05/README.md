### Exercise 14.05

In exercise 7.40 from &sect; 7.5.1 you wrote a sketch of one of the following
classes. Decide what, if any, overloaded operators your class should provide.

(a) `Book`  
(b) `Date`  
(c) `Employee`  
(d) `Vehicle`  
(e) `Object`  
(f) `Tree`

### Solution

For the `Book` class:

Equality operators would be a reasonable addition, to test if Books are the
same, and to be sorted alphabetically by Author then title. Input and output
operators would also be useful to read in and out Books.
