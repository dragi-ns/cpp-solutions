### Exercise 13.21

Do you think the `TextQuery` and `QueryResult` classes need to define their own
versions of the copy-control members? If so, why? If not, why not? Implement
whichever copy-control operations you think these classes require.

### Solution

The default copy-control members are adequate for these classes, therefore
nothing needs to be implemented.
