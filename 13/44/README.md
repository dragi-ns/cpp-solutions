### Exercise 13.44

Write a class named `String` that is a simplified version of the library
`string` class. Your class should have at least a default constructor and a
constructor that takes a pointer to a C-style string. Use an `allocator` to
allocate memory that your `String` class uses.

### Solution

See `string.h`.
