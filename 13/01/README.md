### Exercise 13.01

What is a copy constructor? When is it used?

### Solution

A copy constructor is the constructor that is used when an object's argument is
only a reference to another object of the same type. It is used during defining
variables with `=`, passing objects to and from functions and brace
initializing elements in an array or aggregate class.
