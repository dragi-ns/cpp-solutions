### Exercise 1.17

What happens in the program presented in this section if the input values are
all equal? What if there are no duplicated values?

### Solution

If the input values are all equal, the program will only terminate upon reaching
`EOF` and correctly print the number of inputted values. If there are no
duplicate values, the program will correctly print 1 count for each and
terminate upon reaching `EOF`.
