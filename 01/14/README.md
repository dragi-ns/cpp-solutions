### Exercise 1.14

Compare and contrast the loops that used a `for` with those using a `while`. Are
there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

### Solution

Primarily, clarity would be the main use of preferring a `while` or `for` loop,
depending on circumstance. A `for` loop would be better suited for a loop which
requires initializing a variable, testing a condition and running a final
statement, while a `while` loop is better suited for repeatedly running until a
condition is met. Personally, a `while(1)` is clearer than `for(;;)`.
