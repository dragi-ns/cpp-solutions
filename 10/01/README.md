### Exercise 10.01

The `algorithm` header defines a function named `count` that, like `find`, takes
a pair of iterators and a value. `count` returns a count of how often that value
appears. Read a sequence of `int`s into a `vector` and print the `count` of how
many elements have a given value.

### Solution

See `1.cc`.
