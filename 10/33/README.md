### Exercise 10.33

input file should hold integers. Using an `istream_iterator` read the input
file. Using `ostream_iterator`s, write the odd numbers into the first output
file. Each value should be followed by a space. Write the even numbers into the
second file. Each of these values should be placed on a separate line.
