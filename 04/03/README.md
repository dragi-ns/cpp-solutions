### Exercise 4.03

Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined to give
the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents a trade-off
between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the
language by the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off? Why or
why not?

### Solution

This trade-off is acceptable. The programmer is responsible for understanding
how his code is interpreted and knowing what is and is not compliant, standard
code.
