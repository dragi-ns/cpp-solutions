### Exercise 5.10

There is one problem with our vowel-counting program as we've implemented it: It
doesn't count capital letters as vowels. Write a program that counts both lower-
and uppercase letters as the appropriate vowel -- that is, your program should
count both `'a'` and `'A'` as part of `aCnt`, and so forth.

### Solution

Exercise 5.09 presents a solution using `if` statements. See `10.cc` for a
solution using `switch`.
