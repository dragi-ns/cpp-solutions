### Exercise 6.1

What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

### Solution

An argument initializes a function's parameter. That is, when a function that
requires an argument is called, like `f(x)`, the argument `x` is used to
initialize `count` in `f`'s declaration `int f(int count)`.
