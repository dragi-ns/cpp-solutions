### Exercise 6.23

Write your own versions of each of the `print` functions presented in this
section. Call each of these functions to print `i` and `j` defined as follows:

```cpp
int i= 0, j[2] - {0, 1};
```

### Solution

Note: Not all of the `print` functions provided in this section of the book are
able to deal with integer types or arrays of integers of differing length. See
`23.cc`.
