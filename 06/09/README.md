### Exercise 6.09

Write your own versions of the `fact.cc` and `factMain.cc` files. These files
should include your `Chapter6.h` from the exercises in the previous section. Use
these files to understand how your compiler supports separate compilation.

### Solution

See relevant files. G++-9 generates `a.out` without giving an argument.
