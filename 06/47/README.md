### Exercise 6.47

Revise the program you wrote in the exercises in &sect; 6.3.2 that used
recursion to print the contents of a `vector` to conditionally print information
about its execution. For example, you might print the size of the `vector` on
each call. Compiler and run the program without debugging turned on and again
with it turned off.

### Solution

See `47.cc`.
