### Exercise 6.12

Rewrite the program from exercise 6.10 in &sect; 6.2.1 to use references instead
of pointers to swap the value of two `int`s. Which version do you think would be
easier to use and why?

### Solution

See `12.cc`. The reference version is easier to use, as no thinking about
pointers needs to be done by the user of the function.
