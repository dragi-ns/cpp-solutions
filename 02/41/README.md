### Exercise 2.41

Use your `Sales_data` class to rewrite the exercises in &sect; 1.5.1 (p. 22),
&sect; 1.5.2 (p. 24) and &sect; 1.6 (p. 25). For now, you should define your
`Sales_data` class in the same file as your `main` function.

### Solution

See `1.20.cc` through `1.25.cc` for reworks of those exercises.

TODO 1.22 - 1.25
