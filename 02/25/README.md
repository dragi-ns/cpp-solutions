### Exercise 2.25

Determine the types and values of each of the following variables.

(a) `int* ip, &r = ip;`  
(b) `int i, *ip = 0;`  
(c) `int* ip, ip2;

### Solution

(a) `ip` is a pointer to an `int` with an undefined initial value, and `r` is a
reference to an integer with the value of the pointer `ip`.  
(b) `i` is an `int` with undefined initial value, and `ip` is a null pointer.  
(c) `ip` is a pointer with undefined initial value, and `ip2` is an `int`.
