### Exercise 11.02

Give an example of when each of `list`, `vector`, `deque`, `map` and `set` might
be most useful.

### Solution

`list`s are most useful when adding or deleting elements within the sequence,
`vector`s offer efficient resizing at the end of the sequence. `deque`s offer
efficient resizing at the beginning as well as the end of the sequence but are
not necessarily contingious. `map`s are best used for dictionaries or lookup
tables. `set`s are best used as a unique, sorted dataset.
