### Exercise 11.06

Explain the difference between a `set` and a `list`. When might you use one or
the other?

### Solution

A `set` organizes its data with the element's `<` operator, while a `list` does
not organize its data nor remove duplicates. `set`s are very fast to search, add
and erase elements, but `list`s allow for organization and duplicates.
