### Exercise 3.03

Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the `string` input operator and
in the `getline` function.

### Solution

In the `string` input operator, whitespace is ignored before and after
non-whitespace characters. In the `getline` function, all whitespace is read
except for the final end-of-line character `'\n'.
