### Exercise 3.13

How many elements are there in each of the following `vector`s? What are the
values of the elements?

(a) `vector<int> v1;`  
(b) `vector<int> v2(10);`  
(c) `vector<int> v3(10, 42);`  
(d) `vector<int> v4{10};`  
(e) `vector<int> v5{10, 42};`  
(f) `vector<string> v6{10};`  
(g) `vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};`

### Solution

(a) `v1` has no elements.  
(b) `v2` has one element of value `10`.  
(c) `v3` has two elements of values `10` and `42`.  
(d) `v4` has ten elements of value `0`.  
(e) `v5` has ten elements of value `42`.  
(f) `v6` has ten elements of value `""`.  
(g) `v7` has ten elements of value `"hi"`.
