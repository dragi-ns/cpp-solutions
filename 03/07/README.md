### Exercise 3.07

What would happen if you define the loop control variable in the previous
exercise as type `char`? Predict the results and then change your program to use
a `char` to see if you were right.

### Solution

The program would work the same, because the previous `auto` variable is deduced
to be a `char`. See `7.cc`.
