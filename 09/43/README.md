### Exercise 9.43

Write a function that takes three `string`s, `s`, `oldVal` and `newVal`. Using
iterators and the `insert` and `erase` functions, replace all instances of
`oldVal` that appear in `s` with `newVal`. Test your function by using it to
replace common abbreviations, such as "tho" by "though" and "thru" by "through".

### Solution

See `43.cc`.
