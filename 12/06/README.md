### Exercise 12.06

Write a function that returns a dynamically allocated `vector` of `int`s. Pass
that `vector` to another function that reads the standard input to give values
to the elements. Pass the `vector` to another function to print the values that
were read. Remember to `delete` the `vector` at the appropriate time.

### Solution

See `6.cc`.
